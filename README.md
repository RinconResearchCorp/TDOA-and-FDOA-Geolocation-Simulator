# installing requirements

* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Generate a [Google Elevations API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/elevation/start) and store it in a file called `.env` in the root directory of the project. The file should contain the following text: `GOOGLE_API_KEY=\<your_api_key_here\>`

# How to run the application:
* To run the web application, run `python -m user_interface_webapp.app``

# How to collect data from opensky api for /live-data endpoint

Note that as of now, this is no longer necessary for the webapp to run, but one could connect this to the batch globe rendering with relative ease to visualize live flights around the world

* `pip install -e opensky-api/`
* Follow postgres install instructions in `/flight_data/README.md`
* Update the user and password information in `data_stuff/settings.py` to match your postgres installation
* run `python -m data_stuff.data_collector &` in the background to begin filling your database with live flight data
